Account Description: This account was created minutes ago in order to complete this assignment. It is sure to be used again in the future as a directory for future assignments.
Repository Description: A repository named after my Wake Tech email. It currently has nothing in it besides this README, but is likely to be a playground for future assignements to use and edit in order to teach me.
Cloning: Cloning was done through the use of the program Github Desktop. Once the program was downloaded and installed, I simply logged in with the Github account I created and followed the on screen prompts to clone the only repository the account had onto my desktop.
